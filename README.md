# RoombaGUI
This is a java GUI to connect with a roomba robot powered by a TM4C123G LaunchPad evaluation kit running C-code. To run, place all images in same folder as "src".  This code is only half of the code necessary to run. I do not have footage of the demonstration but by September 2023 I should have a youtube video available showing computer view and robot view.
